# HydraSafe™  
### Compliance Infrastructure for Hydrogen & Reactive-Gas Labs

**HydraSafe reduces time-to-permit, audit risk, and operational uncertainty**  
for synthetic crystal and advanced materials facilities.

---

## The Problem
Every hydrogen-enabled lab faces the same pain:
- Permitting delays
- Inconsistent documentation
- Fire marshal uncertainty
- Commissioning evidence gaps
- Institutional knowledge trapped in people, not systems

These problems scale *with risk* and *with facility growth*.

---

## The Solution
**HydraSafe** is a pre-engineered compliance and safety documentation platform.

It provides:
- AHJ-ready permit packet frameworks
- Commissioning and inspection checklists
- Incident response documentation standards
- YieldOS-compatible safety event definitions

HydraSafe is **infrastructure**, not hardware.
