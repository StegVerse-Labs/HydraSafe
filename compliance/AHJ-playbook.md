# AHJ Playbook (v0.1)

## Goal
Reduce time-to-permit by providing predictable documentation and commissioning evidence.

## Standard packet contents (template)
- Site overview + hazard summary
- Gas inventory + max quantities (operator supplied)
- Detection + shutdown narrative
- Exhaust/vent narrative
- Emergency response plan
- Commissioning test checklist
- Maintenance inspection checklist

## Reminder
Local codes differ. This is a template framework, not legal advice.
